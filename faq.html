           <h2>What is Federated AI with a Low-Power MCU?</h2>
    <p>
        Federated AI with a low-power microcontroller (MCU) enables devices to learn from real-time 
        hardware, firmware, and sideband telemetry <strong>without exporting sensitive data off the device</strong>. 
        Instead of sending raw logs to the cloud, each MCU performs lightweight on-device learning, 
        shares only anonymized model updates, and receives aggregated improvements from the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the learning runs on a <strong>low-power MCU</strong>, it fits within today’s platform constraints—
        minimal CPU, memory, and energy overhead—while still enabling below-OS threat detection. 
        The architecture also integrates seamlessly with existing platform standards such as secure 
        boot, attestation, and firmware update flows.
    </p>
    <p>
        As future MCU generations introduce <strong>dedicated AI acceleration and hardware learning primitives</strong>, 
        the same federated architecture automatically benefits from faster inference, richer models, 
        and further optimization of on-device detection and mitigation.

<h2>What is threat modeling and how does it apply to this solution?</h2>
    <p>
        Threat modeling is the process of identifying and prioritizing how a system can be attacked. 
        For this solution, it ensures our federated AI focuses on the highest‑value firmware, hardware, 
        and sideband attack vectors—enabling accurate detection of below‑OS threats that OS‑level tools 
        miss. For a deeper overview, see

        <h2>How does the learning model for new threats map to static threat modeling?</h2>
        <p>
            Threat modeling defines the static attack surfaces and assets that matter most, and our 
            learning model builds on that foundation by continuously detecting real‑world deviations 
            along those same threat paths. In practice, the threat model defines <em>what to watch</em>, 
            and the federated AI learns <em>how those threats evolve</em>, allowing the system to adapt to 
            new below‑OS attack behaviors while staying aligned with the original security assumptions.

<h2>What is Quantum Computing and the risk it poses to Security?</h2>

<p> Quantum computing poses a major threat to current encryption systems, especially RSA and ECC, which could be broken by quantum algorithms like Shor’s. In response, global efforts are accelerating the adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum-safe protocols to protect digital infrastructure, including IoT, cloud, and embedded systems. </p> <p> This directly undermines the security assumptions behind most modern cryptography algorithms. To counter quantum threats, researchers are developing quantum-resistant algorithms that rely on problems quantum computers can’t easily solve. </p> <p> Quantum threats are especially dangerous for systems with long lifespans and limited update capabilities: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>IoT devices:</strong> Often use ECC or RSA with hardcoded keys. </li> <li> <strong>Automotive ECUs:</strong> May be vulnerable if firmware updates aren’t quantum-safe. </li> <li> <strong>Cloud platforms:</strong> Must transition to PQC across all TLS, VPN, and identity layers. </li> </ul>
</section>
   
 <section class="generic-box">
<h2>How is Quantum readiness addressed?</h2>
    <p>
        Our solution is Quantum ready because its hardware‑anchored federated AI architecture 
        seamlessly adopts the orthogonal evolution of post‑quantum cryptography (PQC), ensuring 
        long‑term resilience as cryptographic standards transition to quantum‑safe algorithms.

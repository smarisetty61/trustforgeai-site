        <li><strong>Security Solution Selling:</strong> Position and sell services focused on <strong>Hardware Root of Trust</strong>, secure boot, attestation, and the protection of AI models at the edge and in the data center.</li>
        <li><strong>Standards & Compliance Advocacy:</strong> Ensure service offerings align with 2025 industry requirements, including the <a href="www.nist.gov">NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)</a> and the <a href="www.opencompute.org">Open Compute Project (OCP)</a> security specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Ecosystem Orchestration:</strong> Serve as the primary liaison between CSP infrastructure architects and ODM manufacturing teams to ensure global execution of secure platform programs.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Pipeline Management:</strong> Lead the full sales cycle from initial technical discovery and RFP responses to the negotiation of multi-million dollar service contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Governance Integration:</strong> Translate 2025 regulatory trends, such as <strong>AI-SBOM</strong> (Software Bill of Materials) mandates and model-integrity verification, into new business opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 0;">Required Qualifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Industry Experience:</strong> 10+ years of leadership in Business Development or Technical Sales within the data center, semiconductor, or server manufacturing sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firmware & Management:</strong> Deep knowledge of BIOS/UEFI, BMC (OpenBMC/AMI), and <strong>DC-SCM</strong> modules.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware Security:</strong> Direct experience with Silicon RoT, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and Platform Firmware Resiliency (NIST SP 800-193).</li>
                <li><strong>AI Security:</strong> Proven understanding of securing AI pipelines, including defense against model poisoning and protecting inference at scale.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Standards Mastery:</strong> Demonstrated experience with <strong>ISO/IEC 42001</strong>, <strong>DMTF (SPDM/MCTP)</strong>, and <strong>FIPS</strong> certification processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Executive Network:</strong> An active roster of decision-makers at Tier 1 CSPs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, Meta) and global ODMs (e.g., Quanta, Foxconn, Wiwynn).</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or Cybersecurity. An MBA or advanced technical degree is highly preferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;margin-bottom: 0;">Preferred Skills & Competencies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2025 Market Insight:</strong> Familiarity with the 2025 <strong>U.S. AI Action Plan</strong> and global AI assurance mandates.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Negotiation:</strong> Success in closing complex, long-cycle contracts involving IP licensing and NRE (Non-Recurring Engineering) services.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Exceptional ability to translate "low-level" hardware security risks into "high-level" business value for C-suite stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Ability to travel up to 40% to engage with ODM partners in Asia and CSP hubs globally.</li>
